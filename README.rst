Oz Graphs
=========

Playing with data extraction and graphing of L. Frank Baum's Oz books.

Finding and Prepping the Texts
------------------------------
Assemble a canonical list_ of the Oz books. 

.. _list: ./intermediate/bibliography.txt

I followed Wikipedia's lead_.

.. _lead: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Oz_books#The_original_and_canonical_Oz_books_by_L._Frank_Baum>

Create a download script for `Project Gutenberg`_ texts, and fetch them.

.. _Project Gutenberg: https://www.gutenberg.org/

.. code:: shell

 cd texts 
 ../code/get-texts   
 cd -

Clean the Project Gutenberg headers from the texts. 
Remove afterwards, the ends, etc. from the texts. 

.. code:: shell

 cd texts
 for i in * ; do 
     ../code/clean-gutenberg-headers $i \
     | ../code/clean-baum-tails \
     > ../intermediate/no_headers/"$i"
 done
 cd -


Break into chapters
-------------------

Confirm that we have the right idea for extracting chapters:

.. code:: shell

 cd intermediate/no-headers
 grep  -i -e '^chapter ' -e '^[0-9]\+\.' * | less
 cd -

At this point,
I realize that there was no point in cleaning anything before the first
chapter heading. 
No harm done.

Make chapters:

.. code:: shell

 cd intermediate/no_headers
 for i in * ; do
     base=$(basename $i .txt)
     mkdir ../chapters/$base
     (cd ../chapters/$base
      ../../../code/chapterize $OLDPWD/$i
     )
 done
 cd -

Make a word list
----------------

Our first step in finding all of the people in the Oz books.

.. code:: shell

 ./code/wordify intermediate/chapters/[0-9][0-9]_*/chapter_[0-9][0-9] |\
  grep '[[:upper:]]' |\
  sort -u >intermediate/upper-case-words.txt

This is just upper case words, including the first word of sentences, 
exclaimations, Dramatic Capitalization, places, etc.
It also na√Øvely does not find constructions such as "the boy" or "the wizard".
I have chosen to *not* fold into lower case before de-duping,
although this reduces the count from 2957 to 2762 -- 
a 7% saving which would be valuable in our next step.
I have also chosen not to remove dictionary words, 
in order to retain constructs such as "King of the Crows".

Human intervention will be required at this point to winnow and munge this 
word list into a set of terms which we can then use to search our corpus.
